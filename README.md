# dustviz

`dustviz` is now expressed in the currently supported top-level Dust grammar profile:

- single executable unit: `src/main.ds`
- entrypoint form: `K main { ... }`

This profile is designed to build with the current `dust` compiler parser without forge/proc namespace syntax.

## Build

From `dust/` compiler workspace:

```bash
CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo-home cargo run -p dust -- obj ../dustviz/src --out-dir /tmp/dustviz_obj
```

## Notes

- The previous multi-file forge/proc DustViz layout was retired for compiler compatibility.
- Fixture artifacts remain in `tests/fixtures/` for future full-pipeline restoration.
